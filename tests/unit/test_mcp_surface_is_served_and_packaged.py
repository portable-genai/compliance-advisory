"""The declared tool catalog is now SERVED, and the plugin is rendered from the declarations.

C1 declared its capability surface twice over, as an A2A agent card and as a governed tool
catalog of JSON Schemas, and served neither. There was no MCP server process anywhere in the
fleet, so a surface described in two places could be read by a human and reached by nobody.

These guards are about the seam rather than the transport. What can go wrong here is not that
MCP breaks; it is that the served surface and the declared surface drift apart, so the catalog
says one thing and the process does another. `bind` refuses that in both directions and these
tests pin both directions with it.

The MCP SDK is in the `[gcp]` extra and is not installed by the offline gate, so everything
below uses `bind`, which is pure. Starting a server is a managed-profile concern; agreeing with
the catalog is not, and it is the half that can silently rot.
